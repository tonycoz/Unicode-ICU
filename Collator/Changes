 - fix build on clang, Collator.xs was using an ICU function without
   including the correct header.
   https://github.com/tonycoz/Unicode-ICU/pull/3

 - improved (I hope) metadata

 - add github workflows for testing on linux and macos

0.004 - 06 Dec 2019

 - use pkg-config to probe the ICU headers/libraries, only use
   icu-config if that fails. (cpan #86373)

 - move bugs to github (the repo was always there)

0.003 - 08 Jan 2018

 - remove ULOC_REQUESTED_LOCALE, this was deprecated and removed by
   libicu. (cpan #124946)

 - if your version of ICU is recent enough, collation now uses
   ucol_strcollUTF8() instead ucol_strcollIter().  Since this fetches
   the UTF8 form of a SV, this may upgrade supplied SVs to a UTF-8
   representation.

0.002 - 02 Feb 2012

 - fix the content of the NAME section, Unicode was spelled incorrectly.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=73960

 - adjust failure message when we can't find icu-config to indicate an
   unsupported platform (ie. one without libicu) rather than some
   generic unknown issue.

 - set a minimum perl version of 5.8.8.

0.001 - 22 Sep 2011

 - initial release
